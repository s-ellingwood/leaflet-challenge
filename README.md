# leaflet-challenge

All files for this project can be found within the Leaflet-Part-1 folder. The index.html file is used to display the final webpage and contains the html code. The static folder contains two folders:
* The css folder which holds the style.css file.
* The js folder which holds the logic.js file used to code the map for index.html.
